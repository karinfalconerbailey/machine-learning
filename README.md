# Machine-Learning
Author: Karin Falconer-Bailey

# Introduction
This project acts as courswork for the Machine Learning module of the MSc Data Science course at City, University of London. The key elements of the coursework were to:
1. Specify a Machine Learning (ML) solution to a data analysis problem;
2. Adjust the ML model parameters and explain how ML seeks to solve the problem;
3. Apply, compare and contrast, and critically evaluate two ML models.

# Software
